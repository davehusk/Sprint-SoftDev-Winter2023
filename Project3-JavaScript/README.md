# README

## Project Overview

This project consists of a set of scripts that interact with JSON data and perform various operations. The scripts are written in JavaScript and Python, and the data is displayed on a simple HTML page.

## Files

1. `script.js`: This JavaScript file fetches a JSON file, processes the data, and displays it on a webpage. It also logs the data and some information about the data to the console.

2. `index.html`: This is the HTML file that displays the data processed by `script.js`. It includes a script tag that links to `script.js`.

3. `data.json`: This JSON file contains the data that `script.js` fetches and processes. It's an array of objects, each representing a person with properties for name, age, city, and active status.

4. `python.py`: This Python script contains various functions for validating data, reading and writing defaults, checking if it's the first of the month, charging monthly stand fees, and more. It also includes a main menu function that allows the user to choose from various options.

## How to Run

To run this project, you'll need a web server to serve `index.html` and `script.js`. You can use any local server. Once the server is running, open `index.html` in your web browser.

The Python script can be run from the command line using the command `python python.py`.

## Dependencies

This project uses native JavaScript and Python and doesn't have any external dependencies. However, you'll need a web server to run the HTML and JavaScript files, and you'll need Python installed to run the Python script.
