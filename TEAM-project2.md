## Winter Sprint - 2023 - SD 10

### Overview of Project 2:
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: The program will present a menu with options to enter new employee details, company revenues, expenses, track car rentals, record employee payments, print financial listings, and quit the program.
- **Defaults File**: A file named 'Defaults.dat' contains default values such as the next transaction number, next driver number, monthly stand fee, rental fees, and HST rate. These values are read at the start and written back at the end of the program.
- **Monthly Stand Fees**: On the first day of each month, stand fees are automatically charged to drivers with their own cars, updating the balance due in the employee table and recording the revenue.
- **Data Files**: Data files for employees, revenues, and expenses are to be created and populated with sample records.
- **Reports**: The program will include options to print a company profit listing and a driver financial listing, with the possibility of adding an additional report based on the ERD.
