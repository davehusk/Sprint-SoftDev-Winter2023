___

**Group A: ERD Design**

**Expected Outcome:** Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the taxi service database based on the provided case study.

**How to Do It:**

1. **Understand the Case Study:** Begin by thoroughly reading and understanding the case study document provided. Make sure you have a clear grasp of the taxi service's requirements and its data needs.

   - *Example*: Imagine you are designing a database for a taxi service that includes driver information, revenue records, and expense details. You should have a clear understanding of what data needs to be stored and how it's related.

2. **Identify Entities:** Identify all the main entities (objects) that will be part of the database. These can include drivers, revenues, expenses, and more. List them down.

   - *Example*: In our case, key entities might be Drivers, Revenues, Expenses, and Vehicles.

3. **Define Attributes:** For each entity, list the attributes (properties) that need to be recorded. Be specific about data types and any constraints (e.g., date of birth is a date type, and it cannot be null).

   - *Example*: For the Drivers entity, attributes might include Driver Name, License Number, Address, Phone Number, etc.

4. **Establish Relationships:** Determine how entities are related to each other. Use lines and notation to show these relationships. Decide on the cardinality (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many).

   - *Example*: Establish a one-to-many relationship between Drivers and Revenues, indicating that one driver can have multiple revenue records.

5. **Add Unique Features:** As instructed, introduce one unique feature to the ERD. This could be a new table, additional fields, or a unique relationship.

   - *Example*: If instructed to add a unique feature, you might create a table for tracking driver performance.

6. **Document Design Choices:** Keep a document where you document your design choices. Explain why you chose certain attributes or relationships. This will help clarify your design rationale.

   - *Example*: Document why you included Driver Address as a separate attribute rather than combining it with Driver Name.

**Stay on Task:**

- **Set Goals:** Break the task into smaller, manageable goals. For example, set a goal to complete steps 1 to 4 in one session.

- **Use Diagram Tools:** Utilize software or tools suitable for ERD design (e.g., draw.io, Lucidchart, or database design software like MySQL Workbench).

- **Regular Check-Ins:** Periodically review your progress and ensure you're following the steps correctly.

- **Ask for Help:** If you encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to ask for clarification or assistance from your team or instructors.

By following these steps and staying organized, we can create a clear and well-structured ERD for the taxi service database as per the project requirements.

___

**Group B: Report Design**

**Expected Outcome:** Design report templates for receipts and listings, specifying formatting and layout, based on the taxi service database ERD.

**How to Do It:**

1. **Identify Report Types:** Determine the types of reports required for the taxi service system. In this case, focus on receipts and listings.

   - *Example*: Consider the need for receipts when a driver rents a car or makes a payment, and listings for financial and operational analysis.

2. **Design Report Templates:** Create templates for each report type. Clearly define the layout, including headings, data fields, and formatting (font, alignment, borders, etc.).

   - *Example*: For a receipt, design a template that includes a header with the company logo, transaction details, and payment information. Use a clear, readable font and align elements neatly.

3. **Include Data Fields:** Specify the data fields that should appear on each report. Ensure that all relevant information is included, such as driver name, transaction date, amount, and description.

   - *Example*: On a receipt, include fields like Driver Name, Transaction Date, Amount Paid, and Payment Method.

4. **Formatting and Styling:** Define the formatting and styling for each report. Specify font sizes, colors, and any additional styling elements.

   - *Example*: Use a larger font size for headings and bold the transaction amount on receipts for emphasis.

5. **Documentation of Design Choices:** Document your design choices, explaining why you chose specific layouts, fonts, or styles. This documentation will help ensure consistency.

   - *Example*: If you chose a specific font because it aligns with the company's branding, explain that choice.

**Stay on Task:**

- **Divide Responsibilities:** If working in a team, assign specific report types or sections to individual team members for focused work.

- **Iterate and Review:** Regularly review your designs and templates to ensure they meet the project's requirements and are visually appealing and informative.

By following these steps and maintaining clear communication within your group, you'll successfully design report templates that meet the project's requirements and effectively convey information.
