> Project 1 involves creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and designing reports for a hypothetical taxi service. The Python-based Project 2 requires developing a menu-driven program for the same taxi service, while Project 3 focuses on JavaScript basics, involving creating, reading, and displaying a JSON file. Lastly, Project 4 is about controlling a robot through an obstacle course[1].


## Project 1 – ERD and Report Design
1. Analyze the case study and identify the entities and relationships.
2. Create an ERD based on the identified entities and relationships.
3. Design various reports and receipts generated by the system.

A potential snippet for this project could be a diagram of the ERD, which is not typically represented in code.

  The case study revolves around a software development project for a small taxi stand, HAB Taxi Services, owned by three brothers: Harry, Archie, and Brian. The project involves creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), designing reports, writing Python code, and working with JavaScript and robots.

Entities identified from the case study include:

1. **Employees**: This includes the three brothers and other drivers. Attributes include driver number, name, address, phone number, driver's license number, expiry date, insurance policy company, policy number, a field to represent if they have their own car, and a field for their balance due.

2. **Revenues**: This records the company's income. Attributes include Transaction ID, date of the transaction, a brief description of the transaction, the driver number that generated the revenue, the amount of the transaction, the HST, and the Total.

3. **Expenses**: This records the company's costs for supplies and repairs to the company cars. Attributes include an Invoice number, an invoice date, the driver number that generated the expense, the item number, description, Cost, the Quantity, and the item total (Cost * Quantity), Subtotal, the HST, and the Total.

4. **Rentals**: This records information when drivers rent one of the company cars. Attributes include a Rental ID, the driver number, the start date of the rental, the car number (1, 2, 3, or 4), whether the rental is for a day or a week, the number of days, the rental cost, the HST, and the total.

5. **Payments**: This records information when a driver makes a payment on their balance due. Attributes include a Payment ID, the driver number, the date of the payment, the amount of the payment, the reason for the payment, and the payment method (Cash, Debit, or Visa).

The relationships between these entities can be inferred as:

1. **Employees to Revenues**: One-to-many relationship, as one employee can generate multiple revenues but each revenue is associated with one employee.

2. **Employees to Expenses**: One-to-many relationship, as one employee can generate multiple expenses but each expense is associated with one employee.

3. **Employees to Rentals**: One-to-many relationship, as one employee can have multiple rentals but each rental is associated with one employee.

4. **Employees to Payments**: One-to-many relationship, as one employee can make multiple payments but each payment is associated with one employee[1].



## Project 2 – Some Python Code
1. Set up a menu-driven interface for the taxi service.
2. Implement features for managing employees, revenues, and expenses.
3. Design and code text-based interfaces based on the ERD.

                Python snippet for this Project

```python
def menu():
    print("HAB Taxi Services Company Services System")
    print("1. Enter a New Employee (driver).")
    print("2. Enter Company Revenues.")
    print("3. Enter Company Expenses.")
    print("4. Track Car Rentals.")
    print("5. Record Employee Payment.")
    print("6. Print Company Profit Listing.")
    print("7. Print Driver Financial Listing.")
    print("8. Your report – add description here.")
    print("9. Quit Program.")
    choice = input("Enter choice (1-9): ")
    return choice
```


## Project 3 – JavaScript FINAL SPRINT
1. Create a JSON file with more than five records.
2. Read the file using the Fetch API in JavaScript.
3. Display the contents of the JSON file using JavaScript functions.

A potential JavaScript snippet for this project could be:

```javascript
fetch('yourfile.json')
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Project 4 – Robot Obstacle Course
1. Position the robot at the start of the obstacle course.
2. Control the robot to perform tasks at different checkpoints based on room types.
3. Complete the obstacle course and return the robot to the start position.

A potential Python snippet for controlling the robot could be:

```python
def start():
    Room1Type = 1 # Fire
    Room2Type = 2 # Skip
    Room3Type = 3 # Person
    robot_ctrl.set_mode(rm_define.robot_mode_free)
```
